    "## Course Description\n",
    "Machine learning models are easier to implement now more than ever before. Without proper validation, the results of running new data through a model might not be as accurate as expected. Model validation allows analysts to confidently answer the question, how good is your model? We will answer this question for classification models using the complete set of tic-tac-toe endgame scenarios, and for regression models using fivethirtyeight’s ultimate Halloween candy power ranking dataset. In this course, we will cover the basics of model validation, discuss various validation techniques, and begin to develop tools for creating validated and high performing models."
